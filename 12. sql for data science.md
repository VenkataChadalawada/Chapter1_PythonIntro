# Basics
### SELECT
- getting a column of a table
``` sql
SELECT name FROM people;
```
- getting what we need
```sql
SELECT 'DataCamp <3 SQL' AS result;
```

- we have peoples table ; Select the title column from the films table.
``` sql
SELECT title FROM films
SELECT release_year FROM films
SELECT name FROM people
```

- Get the title of every film from the films table.
- Get the title and release year for every film.

``` sql
SELECT title FROM films;
SELECT title, release_year FROM films;
SELECT title, release_year, country FROM films;
SELECT * FROM films;
```
### SELECT DISTINCT

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM films;
SELECT DISTINCT certification FROM films;
SELECT DISTINCT role FROM roles;
```

### Learning to COUNT
``` sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews;
```

As you've seen, COUNT(*) tells you how many rows are in a table. However, if you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can call COUNT on just that column.

It's also common to combine COUNT with DISTINCT to count the number of distinct values in a column.

- Count the number of rows in the people table.
- Count the number of (non-missing) birth dates in the people table.
- Count the number of unique birth dates in the people table.
- Count the number of unique languages in the films table.
- Count the number of unique countries in the films table.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)FROM people;
SELECT COUNT(birthdate) FROM people;
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT birthdate) FROM people;
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT language) FROM films;
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT country) FROM films;
```

### Filtering results
In SQL, the WHERE keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:

    = equal
    <> not equal
    < less than
    > greater than
    <= less than or equal to
    >= greater than or equal to
For example, you can filter text records such as title. The following code returns all films with the title 'Metropolis':

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE title = 'Metropolis';

Note that in this course we will use <> and not != for the not equal operator, as per the SQL standard.

#### Simple filtering of numeric values
- Get all details for all films released in 2016.
- Get the number of films released before 2000.
``` sql
SELECT * FROM films WHERE release_year = 2016
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM films WHERE release_year < 2000
SELECT title,release_year FROM films WHERE release_year > 2000
```
#### Simple filtering of text values
- Get all details for all French language films.
- Get the name and birth date of the person born on November 11th, 1974. Remember to use ISO date format ('1974-11-11')!
- Get the number of Hindi language films.
- Get the number of Hindi language films.
- Get all details for all films with an R certification.

```sql 
SELECT * FROM films WHERE language = 'French'
SELECT name, birthdate FROM people WHERE birthdate = '1974-11-11'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM films WHERE language = 'Hindi'
SELECT * FROM films WHERE certification = 'R'
```
### WHERE AND
- Get the title and release year for all Spanish language films released before 2000.
- Get all details for Spanish language films released after 2000.
- Get all details for Spanish language films released after 2000, but before 2010.

``` sql
SELECT title, release_year FROM films where language = 'Spanish' and release_year<2000
SELECT * FROM films where language = 'Spanish' and release_year>2000
SELECT * FROM films where language = 'Spanish' and release_year>2000 and release_year<2010
```

### WHERE AND OR
What if you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not all of the conditions need to be met? For this, SQL has the OR operator.
For example, the following returns all films released in either 1994 or 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994
OR release_year = 2000;

When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');

Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!

### WHERE AND OR(2)
- Get the title and release year for films released in the 90s.
- Now, build on your query to filter the records to only include French or Spanish language films.
- Now you'll write a query to get the title and release year of films released in the 90s which were in French or Spanish and which took in more than $2M gross.
``` sql 
SELECT title, release_year FROM films 
WHERE 
(release_year >= 1990 AND release_year < 2000)

SELECT title, release_year FROM films 
WHERE 
(release_year >= 1990 AND release_year < 2000)
AND (language = 'Spanish' or language = 'French')
AND gross > 2000000
```
### BETWEEN
As you've learned, you can use the following query to get titles of all films released in and between 1994 and 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 1994
AND release_year <= 2000;

Checking for ranges like this is very common, so in SQL the BETWEEN keyword provides a useful shorthand for filtering values within a specified range. This query is equivalent to the one above:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;

It's important to remember that BETWEEN is inclusive, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!
### BETWEEN(2)
Similar to the WHERE clause, the BETWEEN clause can be used with multiple AND and OR operators, so you can build up your queries and make them even more powerful!

For example, suppose we have a table called kids. We can get the names of all kids between the ages of 2 and 12 from the United States:

SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';

Take a go at using BETWEEN with AND on the films data to get the title and release year of all Spanish language films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive) with budgets over $100 million. We have broken the problem into smaller steps so that you can build the query as you go along!

- Get the title and release year of all films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive).
- Now, build on your previous query to select only films that have budgets over $100 million.
- Now restrict the query to only return Spanish language films.
- Finally, modify to your previous query to include all Spanish language or French language films with the same criteria as before. Don't forget your parentheses!

``` sql
SELECT title, release_year FROM films WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000

SELECT title, release_year FROM films 
WHERE 
release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
AND budget>100000000

SELECT title, release_year FROM films 
WHERE 
release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
AND budget>100000000
AND language='Spanish'

SELECT title, release_year FROM films 
WHERE 
release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
AND budget>100000000
AND (language='Spanish' or language='French')

```
### WHERE IN

As you've seen, WHERE is very useful for filtering results. However, if you want to filter based on many conditions, WHERE can get unwieldy. For example:
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age = 2
OR age = 4
OR age = 6
OR age = 8
OR age = 10;
Enter the IN operator! The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause, making it easier and quicker to specify multiple OR conditions! Neat, right?

So, the above example would become simply:
SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age IN (2, 4, 6, 8, 10);

- Get the title and release year of all films released in 1990 or 2000 that were longer than two hours. Remember, duration is in minutes!
- Get the title and language of all films which were in English, Spanish, or French.
- Get the title and certification of all films with an NC-17 or R certification.

``` sql
SELECT title, release_year FROM films 
WHERE 
(release_year = 1990 OR release_year=2000)
AND duration > 120

SELECT title, language FROM films 
WHERE language in ('English', 'Spanish', 'French')

SELECT title, certification FROM films 
WHERE certification in ('NC-17', 'R')

```

### Introduction to NULL and IS NULL
In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. You can check for NULL values using the expression IS NULL. For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NULL;

As you can see, IS NULL is useful when combined with WHERE to figure out what data you're missing.

Sometimes, you'll want to filter out missing values so you only get results which are not NULL. To do this, you can use the IS NOT NULL operator.

For example, this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table.

SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;

### NULL and IS NULL
- Get the names of people who are still alive, i.e. whose death date is missing.
- Get the title of every film which doesn't have a budget associated with it.
- Get the number of films which don't have a language associated with them.

``` sql
select name from people where deathdate isNull
select title from films where budget ISNULL
select count(*) from films where language ISNULL
```
### LIKE and NOT LIKE
As you've seen, the WHERE clause can be used to filter text data. However, so far you've only been able to filter by specifying the exact text you're interested in. In the real world, often you'll want to search for a pattern rather than a specific text string.

In SQL, the LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, you use something called a wildcard as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards you can use with LIKE:

The % wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text. For example, the following query matches companies like 'Data', 'DataC' 'DataCamp', 'DataMind', and so on:

SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'Data%';

The _ wildcard will match a single character. For example, the following query matches companies like 'DataCamp', 'DataComp', and so on:

SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'DataC_mp';

You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to find records that don't match the pattern you specify.

- Get the names of all people whose names begin with 'B'. The pattern you need is 'B%'.
- Get the names of people whose names have 'r' as the second letter. The pattern you need is '_r%'.
- Get the names of people whose names don't start with A. The pattern you need is 'A%'.

```sql
SELECT name FROM people WHERE name like 'B%'
SELECT name FROM people WHERE name like '_r%'
SELECT name FROM people WHERE name NOT LIKE 'A%'
```
### Aggregate functions

Often, you will want to perform some calculation on the data in a database. SQL provides a few functions, called aggregate functions, to help you out with this.
For example,

SELECT AVG(budget)
FROM films;

gives you the average value from the budget column of the films table. Similarly, the MAX function returns the highest budget:

SELECT MAX(budget)
FROM films;

The SUM function returns the result of adding up the numeric values in a column:

SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films;

- Use the SUM function to get the total duration of all films.
- Get the average duration of all films.
- Get the duration of the shortest film.
- Get the duration of the longest film.

``` sql
SELECT SUM(duration) FROM films;
SELECT AVG(duration) FROM films;
SELECT MIN(duration) FROM films
SELECT MAX(duration) FROM films
```
### Aggregate functions practice
- Use the SUM function to get the total amount grossed by all films.
- Get the average amount grossed by all films.
- Get the amount grossed by the worst performing film.
- Get the amount grossed by the best performing film.
``` sql
SELECT SUM(gross) FROM films
SELECT AVG(gross) FROM films
SELECT MIN(gross) FROM films
SELECT MAX(gross) FROM films
```
### Combining aggregate functions with WHERE
Aggregate functions can be combined with the WHERE clause to gain further insights from your data.

For example, to get the total budget of movies made in the year 2010 or later:

SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 2010;

- Use the SUM function to get the total amount grossed by all films made in the year 2000 or later.
- Get the average amount grossed by all films whose titles start with the letter 'A'.
- Get the amount grossed by the worst performing film in 1994.
- Get the amount grossed by the best performing film between 2000 and 2012, inclusive.

``` sql
SELECT SUM(gross) FROM films WHERE release_year >= 2000
SELECT AVG(gross) FROM films WHERE title LIKE 'A%'
SELECT MIN(gross) FROM films WHERE release_year = '1994'
SELECT MAX(gross) FROM films WHERE release_year BETWEEN '2000' AND '2012'

```

### A note on arithmetic
In addition to using aggregate functions, you can perform basic arithmetic with symbols like +, -, *, and /.

So, for example, this gives a result of 12:

SELECT (4 * 3);

However, the following gives a result of 1:

SELECT (4 / 3);

What's going on here?

SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back. So be careful when dividing!

If you want more precision when dividing, you can add decimal places to your numbers. For example,

SELECT (4.0 / 3.0) AS result;

gives you the result you would expect: 1.333.

### It's AS simple AS aliasing
You may have noticed in the first exercise of this chapter that the column name of your result was just the name of the function you used. For example,

SELECT MAX(budget)
FROM films;

gives you a result with one column, named max. But what if you use two functions like this?

SELECT MAX(budget), MAX(duration)
FROM films;

Well, then you'd have two columns named max, which isn't very useful!

To avoid situations like this, SQL allows you to do something called aliasing. Aliasing simply means you assign a temporary name to something. To alias, you use the AS keyword, which you've already seen earlier in this course.

For example, in the above example we could use aliases to make the result clearer:

SELECT MAX(budget) AS max_budget,
       MAX(duration) AS max_duration
FROM films;

Aliases are helpful for making results more readable!
- Get the title and net profit (the amount a film grossed, minus its budget) for all films. Alias the net profit as net_profit.
- Get the title and duration in hours for all films. The duration is in minutes, so you'll need to divide by 60.0 to get the duration in hours. Alias the duration in hours as duration_hours.
- Get the average duration in hours for all films, aliased as avg_duration_hours

``` sql
SELECT title, (gross - budget) AS net_profit FROM films
SELECT title, (duration/60.0) AS duration_hours FROM films
SELECT AVG(duration) / 60.0 AS avg_duration_hours FROM films
```

### Even more aliasing
SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back.

This means that the following will erroneously result in 400.0:

SELECT 45 / 10 * 100.0;

This is because 45 / 10 evaluates to an integer (4), and not a decimal number like we would expect.

So when you're dividing make sure at least one of your numbers has a decimal place:

SELECT 45 * 100.0 / 10;

The above now gives the correct answer of 450.0 since the numerator (45 * 100.0) of the division is now a decimal!

- Get the percentage of people who are no longer alive. Alias the result as percentage_dead. Remember to use 100.0 and not 100!
- Get the number of years between the newest film and oldest film. Alias the result as difference.
- Get the number of decades the films table covers. Alias the result as number_of_decades. The top half of your fraction should be enclosed in parentheses.

``` sql
SELECT COUNT(deathdate) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage_dead FROM people
SELECT MAX(release_year) - MIN(release_year) AS difference FROM films
SELECT (MAX(release_year) - MIN(release_year))/10 AS number_of_decades FROM films

```

### ORDER BY
In this chapter you'll learn how to sort and group your results to gain further insight. Let's go!

In SQL, the ORDER BY keyword is used to sort results in ascending or descending order according to the values of one or more columns.

By default ORDER BY will sort in ascending order. If you want to sort the results in descending order, you can use the DESC keyword. For example,

SELECT title
FROM films
ORDER BY release_year DESC;

gives you the titles of films sorted by release year, from newest to oldest.

### Sorting single columns
- Get the names of people from the people table, sorted alphabetically.
- Get the names of people, sorted by birth date.
- Get the birth date and name for every person, in order of when they were born.

``` sql
SELECT name FROM people ORDER BY name
SELECT name FROM people ORDER BY birthdate
SELECT birthdate, name FROM people ORDER BY birthdate
```

### Sorting single columns (2)
- Get the title of films released in 2000 or 2012, in the order they were released.
- Get all details for all films except those released in 2015 and order them by duration.
- Get the title and gross earnings for movies which begin with the letter 'M' and order the results alphabetically.
``` sql
SELECT title FROM films WHERE release_year in ('2000', '2012') ORDER BY release_year
SELECT * FROM films WHERE release_year <>'2015' ORDER BY duration
SELECT title, gross FROM films WHERE title LIKE 'M%' ORDER BY title

```
### Sorting single columns (DESC)
To order results in descending order, you can put the keyword DESC after your ORDER BY. For example, to get all the names in the people table, in reverse alphabetical order:

SELECT name
FROM people
ORDER BY name DESC;

Now practice using ORDER BY with DESC to sort single columns in descending order!

- Get the IMDB score and film ID for every film from the reviews table, sorted from highest to lowest score.
- Get the title for every film, in reverse order.
- Get the title and duration for every film, in order of longest duration to shortest.
- 
``` sql 
SELECT imdb_score, film_id FROM reviews ORDER BY imdb_score  DESC
SELECT title FROM films ORDER BY title DESC
SELECT title, duration FROM films ORDER BY duration DESC

```
### Sorting multiple columns
ORDER BY can also be used to sort on multiple columns. It will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next, then the next, and so on. For example,

SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people
ORDER BY birthdate, name;

sorts on birth dates first (oldest to newest) and then sorts on the names in alphabetical order. The order of columns is important!

Try using ORDER BY to sort multiple columns! Remember, to specify multiple columns you separate the column names with a comma

- Get the birth date and name of people in the people table, in order of when they were born and alphabetically by name.
- Get the release year, duration, and title of films ordered by their release year and duration.
- Get certifications, release years, and titles of films ordered by certification (alphabetically) and release year.
- 

``` sql
SELECT birthdate, name FROM people ORDER BY birthdate, name
SELECT release_year, duration, title FROM films ORDER BY release_year, duration
SELECT certification, release_year, title FROM films ORDER BY certification, release_year
SELECT name, birthdate FROM people ORDER BY name, birthdate
```
Well done. Notice how the second column you order on only steps in when the first column is not decisive to tell the order. The second column acts as a tie breaker.

### GROUP BY
Now you know how to sort results! Often you'll need to aggregate results. For example, you might want to count the number of male and female employees in your company. Here, what you want is to group all the males together and count them, and group all the females together and count them. In SQL, GROUP BY allows you to group a result by one or more columns, like so:

SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex;

This might give, for example:
sex 	count
male 	15
female 	19


Commonly, GROUP BY is used with aggregate functions like COUNT() or MAX(). Note that GROUP BY always goes after the FROM clause!

As you've just seen, combining aggregate functions with GROUP BY can yield some powerful results!

A word of warning: SQL will return an error if you try to SELECT a field that is not in your GROUP BY clause without using it to calculate some kind of value about the entire group.

Note that you can combine GROUP BY with ORDER BY to group your results, calculate something about them, and then order your results. For example,

SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex
ORDER BY count DESC;

might return something like
sex 	count
female 	19
male 	15
because there are more females at our company than males. Note also that ORDER BY always goes after GROUP BY. Let's try some exercises!

- Get the release year and count of films released in each year.
- Get the release year and average duration of all films, grouped by release year.
- Get the release year and largest budget for all films, grouped by release year.
- Get the IMDB score and count of film reviews grouped by IMDB score in the reviews table.

``` sql
SELECT release_year, count(*) FROM films GROUP BY release_year
SELECT release_year, AVG(duration) FROM films GROUP BY release_year
SELECT release_year, MAX(budget) FROM films GROUP BY release_year
SELECT imdb_score, COUNT(*) FROM reviews GROUP BY imdb_score
```
### GROUP BY with some Mix SQl
Now practice your new skills by combining GROUP BY and ORDER BY with some more aggregate functions!

Make sure to always put the ORDER BY clause at the end of your query. You can't sort values that you haven't calculated yet!
- Get the release year and lowest gross earnings per release year.
- Get the language and total gross amount films in each language made.
- Get the country and total budget spent making movies in each country.
- Get the release year, country, and highest budget spent making a film for each year, for each country. Sort your results by release year and country.
- Get the country, release year, and lowest amount grossed per release year per country. Order your results by country and release year.

``` sql
SELECT release_year , MIN(gross) FROM films GROUP BY release_year
SELECT language , SUM(gross) FROM films GROUP BY language
SELECT country , SUM(budget) FROM films GROUP BY country

SELECT release_year, country, MAX(budget) FROM films
GROUP BY release_year, country
ORDER BY release_year, country

SELECT country, release_year, MIN(gross) FROM films
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY country, release_year
```
### Having
In SQL, aggregate functions can't be used in WHERE clauses. For example, the following query is invalid:

SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
WHERE COUNT(title) > 10;

This means that if you want to filter based on the result of an aggregate function, you need another way! That's where the HAVING clause comes in. For example,

SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;

shows only those years in which more than 10 films were released.

In how many different years were more than 200 movies released?
``` sql
SELECT release_year FROM films GROUP BY release_year HAVING 
COUNT(release_year) >200 
```
### All together
All together now

Time to practice using ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING together.

Now you're going to write a query that returns the average budget and average gross earnings for films in each year after 1990, if the average budget is greater than $60 million.

This is going to be a big query, but you can handle it!
!-- SELECT AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross FROM films
!-- GROUP BY release_year
follow steps
1  Get the release year, budget and gross earnings for each film in the films table.
2  Modify your query so that only records with a release_year after 1990 are included.
3  Remove the budget and gross columns, and group your results by release year.
4  Modify your query to include the average budget and average gross earnings for the results you have so far. Alias the average budget as avg_budget; alias the average gross earnings as avg_gross.
5 Modify your query so that only years with an average budget of greater than $60 million are included.
6 Finally, modify your query to order the results from highest average gross earnings to lowest.
``` sql
SELECT  release_year, budget, gross FROM films
SELECT  release_year, budget, gross FROM films WHERE release_year >1990
SELECT  release_year FROM films WHERE release_year >1990 GROUP BY release_year
SELECT  release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross FROM films WHERE release_year >1990 GROUP BY release_year

SELECT  release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross 
FROM films 
WHERE release_year >1990 
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000

SELECT  release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross 
FROM films 
WHERE release_year >1990 
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000
ORDER BY avg_gross DESC

```

### All together now (2)

Great work! Now try another large query. This time, all in one go!

Remember, if you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the LIMIT keyword to limit the number of rows returned

Get the country, average budget, and average gross take of countries that have made more than 10 films. Order the result by country name, and limit the number of results displayed to 5. You should alias the averages as avg_budget and avg_gross respectively.

``` sql
-- select country, average budget, average gross
SELECT country, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
-- from the films table
FROM films
-- group by country 
GROUP BY country
-- where the country has more than 10 titles
HAVING COUNT(country) > 10
-- order by country
ORDER By country
-- limit to only show 5 results
LIMIT 5
```

Congrats on making it to the end of the course! By now you should have a good understanding of the basics of SQL.

There's one more concept we're going to introduce. You may have noticed that all your results so far have been from just one table, e.g. films or people.

In the real world however, you will often want to query multiple tables. For example, what if you want to see the IMDB score for a particular movie?

In this case, you'd want to get the ID of the movie from the films table and then use it to get IMDB information from the reviews table. In SQL, this concept is known as a join, and a basic join is shown in the editor to the right.

The query in the editor gets the IMDB score for the film To Kill a Mockingbird! Cool right?

As you can see, joins are incredibly useful and important to understand for anyone using SQL.

We have a whole follow-up course dedicated to them called Joining Data in PostgreSQL for you to hone your database skills further!
``` sql
SELECT title, imdb_score
FROM films
JOIN reviews
ON films.id = reviews.film_id
WHERE title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird';
```
